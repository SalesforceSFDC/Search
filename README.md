# Search

*  When you update or create a record, the search engine comes along, makes a copy of the data, and breaks up the content into smaller pieces called tokens. We store these tokens in the search index, along with a link back to the original record.

*  When users enter a term in the search field (1), the search engine breaks up the search term into tokens (2). It matches those tokens to the record information stored in the search index (3), ranks the associated records by relevance (4), and returns the results that users have access to (5).
